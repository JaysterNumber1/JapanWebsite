            The island of Japan is just off the coast of mainland
            <br> Asia. It is between the Sea of Japan to the west and 
            <br> the Pacific Ocean on the east. The land of Japan is
            <br> made up of a variety of terrain, but is mainly rugged
            <br> and mountainous.

            The climate of Japan is quiet varied, much like the US.
            <br>The climate is much more tropical and warm in the more 
            <br>southern prefectures and much colder and snowy in the
            <br> more northern prefectures.

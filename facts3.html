            <br> culture, where both are celebrated often. It is a
            <br> very long-standing culture, but not afraid of adapting
            <br> and evolving with the modern times and technology.

            Japanese Matsuri (or Festivals) bring out a lot of energy
            <br> inside people. These times of celebration are done with
            <br> quiet a bit of noise and pizzazz. The streets will be lined
            <br> with a wide variety of vendors with both food and knick-knacks.
